What is Docker?
Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers and DevOps engineers to package applications and their dependencies into a container. This makes the app portable and consistent across different environments.

Why Learn Docker?
  Easily run applications on any machine
  Build once, run anywhere
  Helps with CI/CD, DevOps, microservices
  Saves system resources compared to virtual machines

Basic Docker Concepts

  Image	A snapshot of your application and its dependencies (like a template).
  Container	A running instance of an image.
  Dockerfile	A script with instructions to build a Docker image.
  Docker Hub	A public registry where Docker images are stored.
  Volumes	Used to persist data outside the container lifecycle.
  Network	Allows containers to communicate with each other and the outside world.

docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx      # Run nginx in a container
docker ps                           # List running containers
docker stop <container_id>          # Stop a container
docker build -t myapp .             # Build image from Dockerfile
docker exec -it <container_id> sh   # Get shell access to a container
